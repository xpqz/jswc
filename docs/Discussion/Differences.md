# Differences between `EWC` and `⎕WC`

Most importantly, `EWC` only supports a subset of the objects supported by
`⎕WC` - and for each of the supported classes, only a subset of the features of
the class. 

If you use an unsupported property, EWC will output a warning
message to the log and continue, in the hope that your application will
work in a degraded mode. The warning message identifies the line of application
code that used the unsupported feature. For example:

`59:15.169 W:   *** Warning: at  Make[16]  wMakeSubForm[8] - Unsupported on button:  FCol  BCol  Accelerator`

You can decide to ignore the warning, work around it, or request support for the 
missing feature from Dyalog. For more information, see the documentation of [supported classes](../ObjectRef/Classes.md).

# Validation and Error Messages

Property validation and error messages are not as reliable as `⎕WC` and `⎕WS`. 
If you provide incorrect property values, the results can be unpredictable:
the property may simply be ignored, in the worst case the form will be blanked
out due to the creation of invalid HTML.

# Implicit Interactive `⎕DQ`

This is supported, but considered experimental. The implementation uses a 
Timer object called _EWC.EWCTIMER within the application namespace.

# Images and ImageLists

Images are handled differently - all images must be made available as image files
that can be loaded by a web browser. See [Images](Images.md) for details.

# Temporary Limitations

The following restrictions are temporary and will be relaxed before the first
supported release:

 * Coord must be (and defaults to) "Pixel"

 * Setting properties must be done using ⎕WC and ⎕WS, assignment is not supported. 
 
 * Up-to-date property values must be retrieved using ⎕WG. Although a namespace
   is created for each EWC object, and there are variables in these spaces that
   correspond to the properties of GUI objects, these values are not kept up-to-date
   when the user manipulates the GUI.
